# SnekScript
This is a VERY basic scripting language that I made when I was bored.<br>
It's basically just a calculator.

### Editor
I made a little online editor: https://scripting.kaialbertson.ca/

### Features
- supports full bedmas opperations + variable assignment
  - `a = (1+3)*5-2^2`
- the print function
  - `print: 5`
- yeah thats it
